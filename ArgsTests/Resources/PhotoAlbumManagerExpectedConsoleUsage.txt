    BlobFilePath* (-B)         The name of a blob to download
    LocalFile (-L)             The local path to download to.  This description does not really need to be this long, but I need to test to make sure that the
                               new description formatting feature that cleanly wraps long descriptions is working properly.  This long description should be
                               enough to test that out!
